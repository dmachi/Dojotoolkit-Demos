To use:

	- git clone git@github.com:dmachi/Dojotoolkit-Demos.git
	- cd Dojotoolkit-Demos
	- ./bin/persvr
	- browse http://localhost:8080/Page/Home

Useful file locations:
	templates/  - root template dir, currently not configurable and everything is relative to it.
		      Inside of the template dir are html templates in a format similar, but not exactly
	 	      like DTL.  It will move towards mimicking that when possible, but differs slightly now.
		      The directory can hold any templates, though there are templates in there that are automatically
		      looked up by name.  First the template system will look for a template by instance id (templates/Page/Home.html, templates/Demo/TestDemo1.html).  
    		      If these aren't found, it will look in the class's name (templates/Page.html, templates/Demo.html).

	WEB-INF/jslib/ - Contains the classes and template system in use for this application
